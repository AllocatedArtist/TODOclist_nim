# TODOclist_nim
A simple TODO List CLI implemented in Nim after 2 hours of learning the language. (NOT INTENDED TO BE USED FOR ACTUAL PURPOSES LOL)

Feature list
- [x] Add/Remove tasks
- [x] Set task status to [COMPLETE] or [INCOMPLETE]
- [x] List all tasks with status
- [x] Save/Load task lists to continue where you left off

This is not meant to be a comprehensive task management application, and was just a hello world project to do in Nim.
Furthermore, it does not handle all edge cases.
- Only handles up to 9 tasks because it reads single input chars EX: 1..9
- Save/Load file paths are hardcoded to "save_file.txt" in the directory of the exe
- And more that aren't immediately obvious :)

 Nim was very easy to pick up especially for a C programmer who likes curly braces and semicolons. I feel a level of productivity with Nim that I haven't really felt using other languages. Hopefully we see me write a lot of games in Nim!
